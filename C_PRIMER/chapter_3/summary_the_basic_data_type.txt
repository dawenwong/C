Keyword:
    The basic data types are set up using 11 Keyword:int ,long ,short ,unsigned ,char , float ,double ,
signed ,_Bool ,_Complex ,and _Imaginary.

Signed Integers:
These can have positive and negative values:
    int--The basic type for a given system.C guarantees at least 16 bits for int.
    short or short int -- The largest short integer is no larger than the largest int and may be smaller.
    C guarantees at least 16 bits for it.
    long or long int -- Can hold an integer at least as large as the largest int and possible larger.C 
    gurantees at least 32 bits for it.
    long long or long long int -- This type can hold an integer as least as large as the largest long and 
    possible larger.The long long type is least 64 bits.
Typically,long will be bigger than short,and int will be the same as one of the two.For example,old Dos-based
systems for the PC provided 16 bits short and int and 32 bits long.

Unsigned Integers:
These have zero or positive values only.This extends the range of the largest possible number.Use the Keyword
unsigned before the desired type:unsigned int,unsigned long,unsigned short.A lone unsigned is the same as 
unsigned int.

Character:
These are typographic symbols such as A,& adn +.By definition,the char type use 1 byte of memory to represnet
a character.Historically,this character byte has most often been 8 bits,but it can be 16 bits or larger.,if
needed to represent the base character set.
    char -- The Keyword for this type.Some implementations use a signed char,but others use an unsigned char.
C enables you to use the Keywords signed and unsigned to specify which form you want.

Boolean:
Boolean values represent true or false;C use 1 for true and 0 for false.
    _Bool--The keyword for this type.It is an unsigned int and need only be large enough to accommodate the 
    range 0 through 1.

Real Floatng Point:
These can have positive or negatibe values:
    float--The basic floating-point type for the system;it can represent at least six significant figures 
    accurately. 
    double -- A (possibly) larger unit for holding floating-point numbers.It may allow more significant figures
    (at least 10,typically more) and perhaps larger exponents than float.
    long double --A (possily) even larger unit for holding floating-point numbers.It may allow more significant
    figures and perhaps larger exponents than double.

Complex and Imaginary Floating Point:
The imaginary types are optional .The real and imaginary components are based on corresponding real type:
    floating _Complex
    double _Complex
    long double _Complex
    float _Imaginary
    double _Imaginary
    long double _Imaginary
