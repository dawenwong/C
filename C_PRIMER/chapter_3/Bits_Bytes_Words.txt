Bits Bytes and Words
The terms bit,byte,and word can be used to describle units of computer data or to describle units of computer
memory.We'll concentrate on the second usage here.
The smallest unit of memory is call a bit.It can hold one or two values :0 or 1.(Or you can say that the bit is 
set "off" or "on".)You can't store much information in one bit,but a computer has a tremendous stock of them.The 
bit is the basic building block of computer memory.
The byte is the usual unit of computer memory.For nearly all machines,a byte is 8 bits,and that is the standard 
definition,at least when used to measure storage.Because each bit can be either 0 or 1,there are 256 possible bit
patterns of 0s and 1s that can fit in an 8-bit byte. These patterns can be used,for example,to represent the integers
from 0 to 255 or represent a set of characters.Representation can be accomplished with binary code,which uses just 0s
and 1s to represent numbers.
A word is the natural unit of memory for a given computer desgin.For 8-bit microcomputers,such as the original Apple,
a word is just 8 bits.Since then,personal computer moved up to 16-bit words,32-bit words,and,at the present,64-bit words
.Larger word sizes enable faster transfer of data and allow more memory to be accessed.
