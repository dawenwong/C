Summary 
A C program consist of one or more functions.Every C program must contain a function called main() because it is the 
function called when the program started up.A simple function consists of a function header followed by an opening 
brace,followed by the statements consistuting the function body,followed by a terminating,or closing,brace.

Each C statement is an instruction to the computer and is marked by a terminating semicolon.A declaration statement 
creates a name for a variable and indentifies the type of the data to be stored in the variable.The name of a variable
is an example of an indentifier.An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable or,more generally,to storage area.
A function call statement causes the named function to be executed.When the called function is done,the program returns
to the next statement after the function call.

The printf()function can be used to print phrases and the values of variable.
The syntax of a language is the set of rules that governs the way in which valid statements in that language are 
put together.The semantics of a statement is its meaning.The compiler help you detect syntax error,but semantic errors 
show up in a program's behavior only after it is compiled.Detecting semantic error may involve tracing the program state-
that is,the values of all variables--after each program step.

Finally,keywords are the vocabulary of the C language.
